The data visualisation in figure 1, represents the various aspects applied to researching Petra's archaeological history using multiple lines of evidence.

The data consists of 23 published studies and illustrates the importance of using multiple categories of evidence to build and develop a coherent picture of Nabataean Petra from 300BCE - 106CE. Representing the data visually allows for patterns to be more easily identified in terms of which categories of evidence have received the most focus and which aspects of research have been introduced as perspectives have advanced.

The word cloud in figure 2 is another visual representation of the data that reveals the 75 most frequently used words used across the published studies, which draws out archaeological features and aspects of research at Petra.

In contrast, the same published studies are presented as a listing in table 1, which doesn't afford the same ability to draw insights or identify patterns.
