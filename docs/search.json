    "text": "GUIDING QUESTIONS\nWhat is the focus of your research topic, and why is it significant?\n\nThe focus is on key publications that have investigated Petra’s archaeological history and the various perspectives applied to build a coherent picture of the ancient Nabataean city. It is significant because it establishes a chronology and looks at how each study has shaped our understanding of Nabataean Petra.\n\nWho is your intended audience, and how does the interface cater to their needs?\n\nSenior high school and undergraduate students seeking a consolidated synthesis of Petra’s archaeological history will find this a useful source, that is delivered using a familar and generally easily accessible medium.\n\nWhat design choices did you make, and what informed these decisions?\n\nA clean and minimal design was used for easy navigation to avoid it being in competition with the material being presented.\n\nWhat challenges did you encounter during the creation process, and how did you address them?\n\nA significant lack of coding experience was a major challenge, which was addressed by presenting various forms of media in a simplistic way within the novice skill level that still had impact and contributed to the narrative structure.\nWorking against the assumption that AI has contributed in small or large part toward the written text portion of the project, given the increasing integration of AI. This was addressed by remaining true to personal values and as a student of academic integrity, whereby no forms of AI were used to write the text portion of this website so as to retain credibility and legitimacy of work.\nIn trying to submit the assessment challenges on file size was a major issue which was addressed by removing videos, many images, which significantly changed the aesthetic of the website, particularly the home page. This took an additional 2 hours to rectify in order to publish and obtain a URL.\n\nHow has this project influenced your understanding of humanities practices?\n\nThat digital tools can enhance research output when harnessed and that it does not diminish the credibility or legitimacy of academic research when it shifts from the traditional analogue format to a digital interface.\n\nIf you were to expand or enhance the interface, what future developments would you consider?\n\nAdding a 3D element so the audience can have a virtual interactive experience with the archaeological evidence."

    "text": "The purpose of this project is to present a visual narrative of Nabataean Petra’s archaeological history from 300BCE - 106CE in the context of a literature review, with the central guiding question of how much do we really know about Petra?\nKey scholarly publications have been reviewed to identify the perspectives applied to Petra and the various aspects of research that have contributed toward building and developing a coherent picture.\nPerspectives on Petra will be a useful resource for senior high school students interested in pursuing studies in archaeology, and undergraduate students seeking a consolidated synthesis of Petra’s archaeological history."

    "text": "The data visualisation in figure 1, represents the various aspects applied to researching Petra’s archaeological history using multiple lines of evidence.\nThe data consists of 23 published studies and illustrates the importance of using multiple categories of evidence to build and develop a coherent picture of Nabataean Petra from 300BCE - 106CE. Representing the data visually allows for patterns to be more easily identified in terms of which categories of evidence have received the most focus and which aspects of research have been introduced as perspectives have advanced.\nThe word cloud in figure 2 is another visual representation of the data that reveals the 75 most frequently used words used across the published studies, which draws out archaeological features and aspects of research at Petra.\nIn contrast, the same published studies are presented as a listing in table 1, which doesn’t afford the same ability to draw insights or identify patterns."
