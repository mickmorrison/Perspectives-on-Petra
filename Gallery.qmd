The gallery is arranged by categories of evidence that accords with figure 1 - 'Perspectives on archaeological studies at Petra from 1935-2022' in the Academic Research at Petra section and serves as a visual narrative of Petra's archaeological history.

The gallery excludes images from Kennedy (2018), Parker (2019), Perry et al. (2020), Aviles et al. (2019), and Propst et al. (2022) as no images were included in the publications.

### TOMBS

Studies on tombs include revealing the structure of Nabataean society and the symbols used to express ideology.

### TEMPLES

A major focus of investigation has been The Great Temple in Petra's city center, which has contributed significantly in building a picture of Petra through this line of evidence.

### SANCTUARY

Sanctuary studies are typically from a religious aspect and reveal a pattern in the location being at high points in Petra's urban and regional landscape. Votive niches known as 'betyls' are usually encountered along the route to a place of high scantuary.
