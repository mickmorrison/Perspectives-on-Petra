title: "About this Project"
---

The purpose of this project is to present a visual narrative of Nabataean Petra's archaeological history from 300BCE - 106CE in the context of a literature review, with the central guiding question of **how much do we really know about Petra?**

Key scholarly publications have been reviewed to identify the perspectives applied to Petra and the various aspects of research that have contributed toward building and developing a coherent picture.

**Perspectives on Petra** will be a useful resource for senior high school students interested in pursuing studies in archaeology, and undergraduate students seeking a consolidated synthesis of Petra's archaeological history.
